  Crypt
  This squat, barrel-vaulted chamber runs roughly north-south. Along either side are the graves of Saxon kings and early bishops of the church long since gone to dust -- one tomb in particular looks undisturbed.
  
  The wight lurks near the south exit.
  
  Someone has painstakingly carved an inscription into the wall above the door.
