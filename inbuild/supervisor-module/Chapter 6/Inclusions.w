[Inclusions::] Inclusions.

To fulfill requests to include extensions, adding their material
to the parse tree as needed, and removing INCLUDE nodes.

@ Our main task here is to look through the syntax tree for |INCLUDE_NT|
nodes, which are requests to include an extension, and replace them with
syntax trees for the extensions in question.

This process is repeated until there are no |INCLUDE_NT| nodes left.
In principle this could go on forever if A includes B which includes A, or
some such, but we log each extension read in to ensure that nothing is
read twice.

exactly the heading which called for the file, except for the annotation in
brackets. (It's to prevent that that we look for a round bracket at the
start of |RESTW| as a sign that the user has accidentally included this.)

Provided a match is made, the |TOPW| words are then thrown away. Their purpose
was just to identify the file sensibly.

no text at all (for instance if Inform could not open the file), or it may be
one we have seen before, thanks to an earlier inclusion. Only when it
provided genuinely new text will its |body_text_unbroken| flag be set,

@h Extension loading.
Note that we ignore a request for an extension which has already been
loaded, except if the new request ups the ante in terms of the minimum
version permitted: in which case we need to record that the requirement has
been tightened. That is, if we previously wanted version 2 of Pantomime
Sausages by Mr Punch, and loaded it, but then read the sentence

>> Include version 3 of Pantomime Sausages by Mr Punch.

then we need to note that the version requirement on PS has been raised to 3.

@h Checking the begins here and ends here sentences.
When a newly loaded extension is being sentence-broken, problem messages
will be turned up unless it contains the matching pair of "begins here"
and "ends here" sentences. Assuming it does, the sentence breaker has no
objection, but it also calls the two routines below to verify that these
sentences have the correct format. (The point of this is to catch a malformed
extension at the earliest possible moment after loading it: it's easy to
mis-install extensions, especially if doing so by hand, and the resulting
problem messages could be quite inscrutable if one extension was wrongly
identified as another.)

First, we check the "begins here" sentence. We also identify where the
version number is given (if it is), and check that we are not trying to
use an extension which is marked as not working on the current VM.

@ This parses the subject noun-phrase in the sentence

>> Version 3 of Pantomime Sausages by Mr Punch begins here.

side-effects: we merely verify that the name matches the one quoted in
the "begins here".
