<p class="commentary firstcommentary"><a id="SP1" class="paragraph-anchor"></a><b>&#167;1. Scheme I.</b>  If source text contains a condition like &quot;if the well has been dry, ...&quot;,
then we need to keep a chronological record by testing at every turn whether
or not the well is dry: we log whether this is true now, whether it has ever
been true, for how many consecutive turns it has been true (to a maximum
of 127), and how many times it has become true having just been false (again,
to a maximum of 127 times). All this information is packed into a single word,
arranged as a 15-bit bitmap: the least significant bit is the state of the
condition now (true or false), the next 7 bits are the number of false-to-true
&quot;trips&quot; observed over time, and the top 7 bits are the number of consecutive
turns on which the condition has been true (&quot;consecutives&quot;). The 16th and
most significant bit is unused, so that the state is always positive even
in a 16-bit virtual machine -- a convenience since we then don't need to
worry about the effect of signed division and remainder on the bitmap.</p>
<p>There is no need to store a flag for &quot;has this condition ever been true&quot;,
because this is equivalent the number of trips being greater than zero.
This might look wrong for a condition which is true at start of play --
say, if the well was always dry -- because then its state has never changed
from false to true. But in fact when the VM starts up the state word is
initially always 0: it's only when the startup rulebook fires the update
chronological records rule (see below) that we first test whether the well
is dry, and that forces a trip from false to true if the well is dry at
start of play. Therefore, if \INWEBMATH(T\INWEBMATH) is the number of trips for the condition
then \INWEBMATH(T=0\INWEBMATH) if and only if the condition has been false from the very start
of play. If the condition is true now, then \INWEBMATH(T=1\INWEBMATH) if and only if it has
always been so.</p>
</div>
<div class="lsmarkdown">
<p class="commentary firstcommentary"><a id="SP2" class="paragraph-anchor"></a><b>&#167;2. Present and Past.</b>  Each individual condition has its own unique &quot;PT number&quot;, counting upwards
from 0 in order of compilation by Inform, and a &quot;chronological record&quot; is a
word array with a state word as described above for each PT number.</p>
<p>However, we keep not one but two chronological records: one for the situation
now, called the &quot;present chronological record&quot;, and one for the situation
as it was just before interesting things most recently happened, called the
&quot;past chronological record&quot;. If one of those interesting things was that
the well ran dry, then in our example the state word for the condition
&quot;if the well has been dry&quot; would be different in the two chronological
records. We keep two records in order to be able to detect conditions in
four different tenses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Present tense (&quot;if the well is dry&quot;): none of this machinery is used,
because we can just test directly instead, so a present tense condition has
no PT-number.</li>
<li>Past tense (&quot;if the well was dry&quot;): we look at the flag bit in the
past chronological record.</li>
<li>Perfect tense (&quot;if the well has been dry&quot;): we look at whether or not
\INWEBMATH(T &gt; 0\INWEBMATH) in the present chronological record.</li>
<li>Past perfect tense (&quot;if the well had been dry&quot;): we look at whether or not
\INWEBMATH(T &gt; 0\INWEBMATH) in the past chronological record.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's a somewhat ambiguous matter of context in English when the reference time
is for past tenses. If somebody comes out into the sunshine and says, &quot;But
it was raining,&quot; when does he mean? We would reasonably guess earlier that
day, and probably only an hour or two ago, but that's a contextual judgement
made on the basis of our own experience of how rapidly weather changes.
The context for Inform source text is always that of actions, so our
convention is that the reference time for past tenses is the point just
before the current action began. Such key moments -- when things are just
about to happen -- are called &quot;chronology points&quot;. There is a CP just
before each action begins; there is a CP in the startup process; and there
is a CP at the end of each turn, for good measure. CPs happen when somebody
calls <code>ChronologyPoint()</code>. The action machinery does this directly, while
the startup CP and the CP at end of turn happen in the course of the
update chronological records rule (below).</p>

will go on developing, while the past will remain as it was; until things
calm down again and we come to another chronology point.</p>

<li><code>wanted</code> describes what information the function should return, as

<div class="lsmarkdown">
<p class="commentary firstcommentary"><a id="SP6" class="paragraph-anchor"></a><b>&#167;6. Scheme II.</b>  Actions discussed in the past tense -- &quot;if we have taken the ball&quot; or,
more subtly, &quot;Instead of waiting for the third turn&quot; (which also refers
to the past) -- are handled in a related but simpler way. Inform counts such
references, just as with other past tense conditions above, but this time
stores a state in two simple word arrays: <code>TimesActionHasHappened</code> and
<code>TurnsActionHasBeenHappening</code>.</p>
<p>It might reasonably be asked why we don't simply use all of the clever
machinery above: why have an entirely different system here? One reason is
that actions are events and not continuous states of being. &quot;The well is
dry&quot; could be true for any extent of time, but &quot;taking the ball&quot; either
happens at a given moment or doesn't: it is not continuously true. We are
therefore in the business of counting events, not measuring durations.
Another reason is that the point of reference for past tenses is different.
It makes no sense to say &quot;if we were looking&quot; because that would mean at
a time just before the current action, when actions were probably not
happening at all; while &quot;if we had looked&quot; and &quot;if we have looked&quot;
would almost always be identical in meaning for the same reason. So we need
a much simpler system with just one possible past tense; we don't need to
keep two different states; and we use the extra storage to enable us to
count the number of times, and the number of turns, to at least 31767
instead of stopping at 127. (We also generate more legible code to test
past tense actions.)</p>
</div>
<div class="lsmarkdown">
<p class="commentary firstcommentary"><a id="SP7" class="paragraph-anchor"></a><b>&#167;7. Past Action Routines.</b>  Actions can be quite complicated to test even in the present, and this is
much more conveniently done in a routine with its own Inform-generated stack
frame; so each past tense action has its own testing routine, with a name
like <code>PAPR_41</code>, which returns true or false depending on whether the action
is going on now. The word array <code>PastActionsI6Routines</code> then contains a
null-terminated list of these routines.</p>
</div>
<p class="commentary firstcommentary"><a id="SP8" class="paragraph-anchor"></a><b>&#167;8. Track Actions.</b> </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Instead of taking the top hat less than three times...</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Every turn jumping for three turns: say "A demon appears!"</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Check requesting the pronoun meanings for the first time: ...</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="lsmarkdown">
<p>The routine <code>TrackActions</code> then updates the two arrays, and is the
equivalent for past tense actions of <code>ChronologyPoint</code>. It's called
twice for each in-world action: <code>TrackActions(false)</code> just as a new
action is about to begin, and then <code>TrackActions(true)</code> just after it
has finished -- note in particular that if action B happens in the
middle of action A, for instance because of a try phrase, then the
<code>TrackActions(true)</code> call for B happens when A is back as the current
action. In fact, that's the point: because it tells us that B was not
the main action for the turn, but only a phase which has now passed
again.</p>
<p>For each of the action patterns we track, we need to count the number of
times such an action has been tried ({\it not} the number of times it
succeeded), and also the number of consecutive turns on which it has been
&quot;the&quot; action. The count of the number of tries is unambiguous and easy to
keep: it is incremented at the start-of-action call only, and only if the
action matches. But the consecutive turn count is more problematic. The
user wants to think of actions and turns as synonymous, and to write
conditions like &quot;Before going for the third turn&quot;, and we want to play
along because that's a natural phrasing: but actions and turns are not
synonymous at all. The rules are therefore:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>(1) At the start-of-action call, provided the action is not a silent one,
the consecutive turns count is either incremented or zeroed, depending on
whether the action matches. Silent actions are ignored because they are
almost always knock-on actions tried in the course of other actions, and
are certainly not the &quot;main&quot; action of the turn. But the count can be
incremented only once in the course of each turn, so that &quot;Instead of
taking something for the third turn: ...&quot; cannot happen on the very first
turn because TAKE ALL causes three or more take actions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(2) At the readjustment call, provided the action is not a silent one,
the consecutive turns count is zeroed if the action does not match.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Why do we zero the count? Well, suppose that the player types OPEN BOX, so that
the opening action takes place, and that it causes a further (non-silent)
action, say examining the lid: and suppose that the action pattern we track the
turn count for is &quot;examining something&quot;. Then the following calls take place:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>TrackActions(false)</code> while the action is &quot;opening the box&quot;.
Turn count zeroed by rule (1).</li>
<li><code>TrackActions(false)</code> while the action is &quot;examining the lid&quot;.
Turn count incremented by rule (1).</li>
<li><code>TrackActions(true)</code> while the action is &quot;opening the box&quot;.
Turn count zeroed by rule (2).</li>
<li><code>TrackActions(true)</code> while the action is &quot;opening the box&quot;.
Turn count zeroed by rule (2).</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus rule (2) prevents us from counting this turn as the first of a sequence
of turns in which examining something was the action, because it wasn't the
main action of the turn.</p>
<p>A further complication is that we need to record the qualification, or not,
even of silent actions, because testing rules like</p>
</div>
<div class="lsmarkdown">
<p>works by checking that (a) we are currently taking the top hat, and (b) have
done so fewer than three times before. (b) uses the turn count described
above; but (a) cannot simply look to see if that count is positive, since
the action might be happening silently and thus not have contributed to the
count; so we also record a flag to hold whether the action seems to be
happening in this turn, silent or not.</p>
<p>And a still further complication is that out-of-world actions should never
affect counts of turns for in-world actions. Thus,</p>
</div>
<div class="lsmarkdown">
<p>must not have the count to three broken by the player typing SAVE, which
causes an out-of-world action but doesn't use a turn. The simplest way to
deal with that would be to make <code>TrackActions</code> do nothing when <code>oow</code>
is set, but then we would get rules like this wrong:</p>
</div>
<div class="lsmarkdown">
<p>because it {\it does} make sense for OOW actions to have a count of how
many times they've happened, even though they don't occur in simulated
time. An OOW action can cause its own <code>ActionCurrentlyHappeningFlag</code>
to be set, but it can't cause any other action's flag to be cleared, and nor
can it zero the turns count for another action.</p>
