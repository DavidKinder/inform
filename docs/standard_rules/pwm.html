those tried and tested by I6, the idea of concealment is an exception. The
old I6 attribute <code>concealed</code> simply marked some objects (which we would
call &quot;things&quot;) as being hidden from view in some way, but was never very
satisfactory. What does hidden mean, exactly -- to whose eyes, and in what
way? Should you be able to take something which is hidden, if you happen to
know it's there? And so on. It was the muddiest of all the attributes, and
widely disused as a result. In I7, we instead took the view that
concealment required an active agent continuously doing the concealing: it
applies, for instance, to a dagger which someone intentionally hides
beneath a cloak, but not to a key placed at the back of a shelf by somebody
long gone.</p>

undescribed, default behavior should be the same to what it would be if it were empty. The
following adjectives assist the maintenance of the deceit.</p>
<p>Something is obviously-occupied if it has at least one obvious (neither concealed nor
undescribed) thing in it, but closed opaque containers the player is outside of aren't
obviously-occupied because their status isn't obvious. The player is undescribed and so
the player's own presence in an enterable supporter or container doesn't count toward it
being considered occupied. The opposite of obviously-occupied is possibly-unoccupied.
Something is possibly-unoccupied if it's truly empty, or the only things in it are concealed
or undescribed (or both), or it's a closed opaque container the player is outside of.</p>
<p>Something is falsely-unoccupied if it's not a closed opaque continer the player is outside
of and it's not truly empty but everything in it is concealed or undescribed. Note that
falsely-unoccupied is not the opposite of obviously-occupied. Possibly-occupied is the
opposite of obviously-occupied; falsely-occupied is something different.</p>
<p>None of this considers visibility per se and they behave the same way in light or
darkness. The presumption is that if the game is evaluating whether the player can perceive
the contents of a thing, it has already been determined that they can perceive that
thing.</p>
<p>These tests only consider what's directly contained or supported. If there's an obvious
thing its contents can't make it any less obvious; if something is undescribed or
concealed, it's assumed that the game shouldn't be calling attention to their contents.</p>
<p>These adjectives are not defined for people. Things directly held by the player are always
perceptible by the player. Things possessed by other people aren't mentioned by default
in room descriptions or when searching or examining them, but only through whatever rules
an author adds to do so, so the details are left to the author.</p>

<p>This framework is the minimum kit needed in order for Inform to be able to
manage the spatial relationships arising from its basic verbs. Room and thing
are needed to distinguish places and objects; door and backdrop because they
need to violate the basic rule that an object can only be in one place at once
-- a door is &quot;in&quot; both of the rooms it faces onto -- and this requires special
handling by Inform; region because it violates the rule that rooms are not
themselves subject to being contained in other objects, and again this
requires special handling. That leaves &quot;direction&quot;, &quot;container&quot;, &quot;supporter&quot;
and &quot;person&quot;, and these are needed to express the concepts inherent in the
sentences &quot;A is east of B&quot;, &quot;A is in B&quot;, &quot;A is on B&quot; and &quot;A is carried by B&quot;.
(We also need room and person in order to make sense of the words &quot;somewhere&quot;
and &quot;someone&quot;, for instance.)</p>
<p>Although further kinds will be created later (&quot;vehicle&quot;, for instance),
those are merely design choices, and Inform would not be troubled by their
absence.</p>
<p>In addition to the more physical kinds, &quot;concept&quot; is used by the dialogue system
for ideas or subjects to think about.</p>

&quot;object&quot;, not &quot;region&quot;, even though we think of it as always being a
region. This is because of I7's type-checking rule: the type &quot;object&quot; can
legally hold 0, meaning &quot;nothing&quot;, but more specific object types -- in
this case &quot;region&quot; -- cannot. That would make them illegal to use in a
situation where no regions were created, because variables or properties of
this kind couldn't be initialised. This is why the Standard Rules almost
always declare object properties as &quot;object&quot; rather than anything more
specific.</p>

flexibility of the I6 world model, which we largely adopt for I7 too. That
is, you can have any combination of lit/unlit, edible/inedible, fixed in
place/portable, and so on. We can divide them into three broad categories:
first, physical properties. Things come in \INWEBMATH(2^6 = 64\INWEBMATH) physically different
varieties, which is rather a lot, but although some combinations are very
rare (edible lit pushable between rooms scenery is not met with often)
this flexibility is helpful in mitigating the rigidity of the kinds
structure, given that we have single inheritance of kinds. Note that,
except for &quot;lit&quot;, these are all really to do with whether and how people
can move things around -- even edibility, which is the ability to be removed
from the world model entirely.</p>

not rooms. They are not positions in the world, but imaginary arrows pointing
in different ways one could go from those positions. In the language of
geometry, we could call them tangent vectors which can be taken anywhere
in space by parallel transport without altering them: that's to say, the
&quot;north&quot; in one place is the same as the &quot;north&quot; anywhere else. (This
is how we get away with having just one set of 12 direction objects, not
12 different ones for every location.) Implicit in that assumption is that
the model world occupies a &quot;flat&quot; Euclidean space, to use further
mathematical jargon: it doesn't wrap around on itself, and there are no
bad positions where the directions fail. (Compare the Infocom game &quot;Leather
Goddesses of Phobos&quot;, in which the South Pole of Mars is just such a
singularity: there are three routes out of this location, all of them
&quot;north&quot;. This of course required special programming, and so it would in
an Inform 7 work, too.) More concisely:</p>

<p class="commentary firstcommentary"><a id="SP25" class="paragraph-anchor"></a><b>&#167;25. </b>  The Standard Rules define only thirteen I7 objects, and here we go with
twelve of them: the standard set of directions, which come in six pairs
of opposites.</p>
<p>The following set -- N/S, NE/SW, E/W, SE/NW, U/D, IN/OUT -- is rooted in IF
tradition. It seems unlikely that people would make IN/OUT a pair of
directions today if starting from a clean slate: this is really a residue
of the traditional implementation, in 70s and 80s IF, of commands which
moved the player in unorthodox way. Outside the cave mouth, typing IN
should take you inside; in the Y2 Rock Room, typing the magic word PLUGH
should take you far away. The most convenient way to implement such
commands in as few instructions as possible was to regard these as
little-used compass directions rather than independent commands (some
implementations of the original Adventure regarded XYZZY, PLUGH, PLOVER as
all being directions, thus using 15 of the 16 possibilities which could be
represented in a 4-bit field). In the 90s this was seen to be a little
bogus, but since IN and OUT clearly applied in a variety of settings, they
continued to be regarded as bona fide directions. In effect, they allow for
one location to surround another: the canonical example would be a small
white building in the middle of a field. Anyway, I7 accepts the current
orthodoxy, so IN/OUT are allowed, even though they cause headaches for the
interpretation of words like &quot;inside&quot; which might refer either to the
&quot;horizontal&quot; or &quot;vertical&quot; spatial models as a result.</p>
<p>Of the rest, N/S, NE/SW, E/W, SE/NW and U/D, it's noteworthy that this
choice imposes a cubical grid on the world, simply because the compass
directions are at 45 and 90 degree angles to each other: a hexagonal
tessellation would be more faithful to distances (it would get rid of the
awkward point that a NE move is root 2 times the length of a N move),
but in practice the world model doesn't care much about distances, another
example of its qualitative nature. A further point is that, in a
three-dimensional cubic lattice, we ought to have another eight pairs
of directions for &quot;up and northeast&quot;, &quot;down and west&quot; and so on --
instead of which U/D are the only ways out of the horizontal plane.
But natural language doesn't work that way: it overwhelmingly provides
words for horizontal travel, because that's the plane in which our eyes
normally see, and in which we normally walk. Linguistically, &quot;north&quot;
genuinely means north, but &quot;up&quot; allows for any amount of lateral
movement into the bargain. It's a doctrine of I7 that linguistic bias is
a good guide to what's worth modelling and what is not, so we will now
stop worrying about this and declare the actual objects.</p>
<p>The order of definition of the directions affects the way lists come out:
the traditional order is N, NE, NW, S, SE, SW, E, W, U, D, IN, OUT.</p>

I7 doors are present on both sides, they do nevertheless have two sides.
The representation of this is quite tricky because, as Stoppard implies,
it's all a matter of which side you look at it from. What we call the
&quot;other side&quot;, and whether or not we say that &quot;the Ballroom is through
the green door&quot;, depends entirely on which side of the green door we
stand. The awkward truth is that these expressions are undefined unless
the player is in one of the (possibly) two rooms in which the green

in the code handling property evaluation which made &quot;door_to&quot; a special case,

ideas, but then we also turn out to want some behaviour D which is shared

code when it comes to (say) printing out top ten lists of basketball
players (people) and skyscrapers (buildings) in height order: why not?
But then again, what does D conceptually represent? Surely we aren't saying
there's a natural concept of &quot;basketball player/skyscraper&quot;?</p>
<p>There are various responses, of which the most widely used now is probably
that of <code>C++</code>'s notion of templates. We would define our top-ten business

that \INWEBMATH(T\INWEBMATH) provided a height: there would then be no need for &quot;basketball

It may well be argued that this is because the I6 world model is so sketchy
in modelling them, but that may actually be a good thing, because it's not at
all obvious that any single model will be sensible for what different
authors want to do with their characters.</p>
<p>On gender, see also the &quot;man&quot; and &quot;woman&quot; kinds below. Note that we have
three gender choices available -- male, female and neuter -- but these are,
for historical reasons to do with how gender is handled by the I6 library,
managed using either/or properties rather than a single three-way value
property. This doesn't in practice cause trouble. (Specifying something as
neuter overrides the male/female choice, if anyone does both for the same
object, but in practice nobody does.) When nothing is said about a person's
gender, it is assumed male, though this is used only linguistically (for
instance, the pronoun HIM can be used in commands about the object, rather
than HER or IT). There has to be some convention here, and in a case where
we don't know our linguistic ground, opting for the least surprising
behaviour seems wisest.</p>
<p>The Inform compiler automatically applies the either-or property <code>animate</code>

might have overridden this with a sentence like &quot;The printed name of the

<p class="commentary firstcommentary"><a id="SP38" class="paragraph-anchor"></a><b>&#167;38. Non-fundamental kinds.</b>  We have now finished defining the nine fundamental kinds which Inform requires
in order for it to function. There are six more to define, but it's worth
emphasising that none of these is required or assumed by either Inform or
its template layer of I6 code. So any of them could be changed drastically
or got rid of entirely simply by amending the Standard Rules. (Like the
&quot;player-character&quot; kind, born early 2003, died July 2007.)</p>
<p>Equally, we could add others if we wanted. The judgement of what ought to be
part of the basic hierarchy of kinds created by the Standard Rules isn't
easy. The maximalist position is that users welcome a plethora of kinds to
simulate many facets of real life, from canal-boats to candles. The minimalist
position is that kinds are necessary only as the domain of relations (so that
person is necessary as the domain of P in &quot;P carries X&quot;, for instance), and
that too many kinds confuses the picture and imposes what may be a constraining
structure on the user, who should be free to decide for himself what concepts
are most helpful to organise. These arguments are discussed further in the
white paper, &quot;Natural Language, Semantic Analysis and Interactive Fiction&quot;
(2005), but briefly: we are minimalist but not puritanically so.</p>
</div>
<div class="lsmarkdown">
<p class="commentary firstcommentary"><a id="SP39" class="paragraph-anchor"></a><b>&#167;39. Men, women and animals.</b>  Of these discretionary kinds, so to speak, &quot;man&quot; and &quot;woman&quot; are perhaps
the least challengeable. They are not obviously the domains of any
natural relation (unless one takes a very old-fashioned idea of gender
identity and supposes that, oh, &quot;X keeps Y&quot; implies that X is a wealthy
man and Y a mistress). But they are so linguistically natural in story-telling:
who would ever write &quot;Jack is a person in the House. Jack is male.&quot; in
preference to &quot;Jack is a man in the House.&quot;</p>
<p>An awkward point here is that, of course, most people would simply say &quot;Jack
is in the House.&quot; and expect us to infer that Jack is a person from the fact
that this is more often a human name than, say, a proprietary brand of
microphone plug; and that Jack is male, because relatively few girls called
Jacqueline are nicknamed Jack. As it happens the Inform compiler doesn't allow
for tentative statements about the kinds of objects (only about their
property values), but it wouldn't be too hard to add such a system, with
a little care. The trouble is that we would then need a large dictionary of
boys' and girls' names, valid across American, Canadian, Australian and
British English (together with a selection from foreign tongues), and this
would always lead to puzzling omissions (why isn't &quot;Glanville&quot; recognised?)
or ambiguities (why is &quot;Pat&quot; a man?). And similarly for titles: &quot;Mr&quot;,
&quot;Mrs&quot; and &quot;Ms&quot; are fairly indicative of gender, except in certain
military contexts, but what about (say) &quot;Admiral&quot; or &quot;Reverend&quot;, where
there is a strong likelihood of masculinity but no more than that?
So Inform 7's compromise position is that the user does have to specify
gender explicitly, but that the kinds &quot;man&quot; and &quot;woman&quot; provide
conveniently abbreviated ways to do so. (We consider male and female
children to qualify in these categories.)</p>
<p>Anyway, we set out the Anglo-Saxon plurals, and then declare these kinds
purely in terms of gender: they have no distinguishing behaviour.</p>

domestic animals have been part of human society since prehistoric times:
but then again, the same can be said for stoves and larders, and we aren't
declaring kinds for those.</p>
<p>The reason &quot;animal&quot; exists is mainly because it is almost always peculiar
to write &quot;P is a person&quot;. Now that we have &quot;man&quot; and &quot;woman&quot; taken
care of, the remaining objects we might want to declare will almost always
fall into this category: it's intended to be used for &quot;people&quot; who are
animate but probably not intelligent, or anyway, not participants in human
society. It seems unusual to write &quot;The black Labrador is a person.&quot;
because that sounds like an insistent assertion of rights and thus a quite
different sort of statement. (Don't drown that Labrador! He's a person.)</p>
<p>As can be seen from the tiny definition of &quot;animal&quot;, though, it's really
nothing more than a name for a position in the kinds hierarchy. There is
not even any implication for gender.</p>

largely for traditional reasons -- such a concept existed in the I6 library,
which in turn followed Infocom conventions dating from the early 1980s.
The inclusion is defensible as representing a common linguistic category
found in everyday situations, where an inanimate object nevertheless does
something while under direct or indirect human control: we can also imagine
relations for which it could be a domain (&quot;X is able to work D&quot; meaning
that person X understands how to use the controls of device D, say). It
could equally be attacked as having a rather flimsy world model -- it's just
an on/off switch -- and representing a pretty inchoate mass of concepts,
from a mousetrap to a nuclear reactor.</p>

<p class="commentary firstcommentary"><a id="SP42" class="paragraph-anchor"></a><b>&#167;42. Vehicles.</b>  Here again the justification boils down to tradition. Vehicles were a
staple ingredient of the Infocom classics, largely because of code
originally written for the inflatable boat in the 1978-79 mainframe version
of &quot;Zork&quot;, which was then copied through into later titles. Unlike
devices, though, vehicles are genuinely difficult to model, and the
implementation provided by the Standard Rules would be quite a lot of
work for a user to manage alone. (Consider, for instance, the case when
the player is sitting in an open basket when Bill, driving a fork-lift
truck, uses his vehicle to push the basket into another room.) There
might perhaps be a case for moving all of the vehicles material into
an extension, but it would have to be an extension supplied as part of
the built-in set, and whenever it was used the result would be that
the going action would rely on a pretty complicated interlacing of rules
as between this extension and the Standard Rules.</p>
<p>Turning to implementation, I6 -- surprisingly, perhaps -- doesn't have
a <code>vehicle</code> attribute: a vehicle is an object which is <code>enterable</code> and
whose <code>before</code> rule for the I6 <code>##Go</code> action returns the magic value 1.
A troublesome point here is that I6 makes no distinction between vehicles
which contain and vehicles which support. But we do, because once we have
decided to make &quot;vehicle&quot; a kind, it has to be either a kind of container
or a kind of supporter: it can't be both. We get around this by providing
for container-vehicles in the Standard Rules, as being the more commonly
occurring case, while providing for the other with the extension Rideable
Vehicles by Graham Nelson, which is in effect an offshoot of the Standard
Rules and is built-in to every installation of Inform 7. This also provides
for animals used as vehicles.</p>
<p>The alternative approach here would be to make &quot;vehicle&quot; not a kind but
an either/or property of things, so as to provide a pattern of behaviour
common to certain animals, containers and supporters. We could then move
Rideable Vehicles back into the Standard Rules, but that would add a fair
amount of code, and besides, it is unclear that &quot;vehicleness&quot; is something
we want to come and go during play, or that it's appropriate as an either/or
property of (for instance) a door or a person.</p>

giving the Inform compiler a dictionary to tell it how I7's names for
properties -- some value properties, some either/or -- mesh with those
in the I6 library.</p>
<p>Ordinarily, a new value property such as &quot;astral significance&quot; would
be compiled by Inform into an I6 property called something like</p>

I6 property holding only <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>, at the compiler's discretion.

of attributes, whereas there are no limits on the number of properties used
in I7.) And if &quot;astral significance&quot; is a concept handled only by I7
source text, that's fine.</p>
<p>But we want our &quot;printed name&quot; property, for instance, to be the text
which the I6 library prints out whenever it uses the <code>short_name</code> of an

for &quot;printed name&quot;, not to invent a new one. Inform therefore maintains a
