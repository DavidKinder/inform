[ExternalFiles::] External Files.

To register the names associated with external files, and build
the small I6 arrays associated with each.

@ The test group |:files| exercises the features in this feature.

The following is called to activate the feature:

=
void ExternalFiles::start(void) {
#pragma clang diagnostic push
#pragma clang diagnostic ignored "-Wincompatible-function-pointer-types-strict"
	PluginCalls::plug(PRODUCTION_LINE_PLUG, ExternalFiles::production_line);
	PluginCalls::plug(MAKE_SPECIAL_MEANINGS_PLUG, ExternalFiles::make_special_meanings);
	PluginCalls::plug(NEW_BASE_KIND_NOTIFY_PLUG, ExternalFiles::files_new_base_kind_notify);
	PluginCalls::plug(NEW_INSTANCE_NOTIFY_PLUG, ExternalFiles::files_new_named_instance_notify);
#pragma clang diagnostic pop
}

int ExternalFiles::production_line(int stage, int debugging,
	stopwatch_timer *sequence_timer) {
	if (stage == INTER1_CSEQ) {
		BENCH(RTMultimedia::compile_files);
	}
	return FALSE;
}

@h One special meaning.
We add one special meaning for assertions, to catch sentences with the shape:

>> The File of Wisdom (owned by another project) is called "wisdom".

=
int ExternalFiles::make_special_meanings(void) {
	SpecialMeanings::declare(ExternalFiles::new_file_SMF, I"new-file", 2);
	return FALSE;
}
int ExternalFiles::new_file_SMF(int task, parse_node *V, wording *NPs) {
	wording SW = (NPs)?(NPs[0]):EMPTY_WORDING;
	wording OW = (NPs)?(NPs[1]):EMPTY_WORDING;
	switch (task) { /* "File... is the file..." */
		case ACCEPT_SMFT:
			if ((<nounphrase-external-file>(SW)) && (<new-file-sentence-object>(OW))) {
				parse_node *O = <<rp>>;
				<np-unparsed>(SW);
				V->next = <<rp>>;
				V->next->next = O;
				return TRUE;
			}
			break;
		case PASS_1_SMFT:
			ExternalFiles::register_file(Node::get_text(V->next),
				Node::get_text(V->next->next));
			break;
	}
	return FALSE;
}

@ And this is the Preform grammar needed for the subject phrase:

=
<external-file-sentence-subject> ::=
	<definite-article> <external-file-sentence-subject> |  ==> { pass 2 }
	internal data/binary <external-file-name> |            ==> { INTERNAL_BINARY_FILE_NFSMF, -, <<ownership>> = R[1] }
	internal text <external-file-name> |                   ==> { INTERNAL_TEXT_FILE_NFSMF, -, <<ownership>> = R[1] }
	text <external-file-name> |                            ==> { EXTERNAL_TEXT_FILE_NFSMF, -, <<ownership>> = R[1] }
	binary <external-file-name> |                          ==> { EXTERNAL_BINARY_FILE_NFSMF, -, <<ownership>> = R[1] }
	<external-file-name>                                   ==> { EXTERNAL_TEXT_FILE_NFSMF, -, <<ownership>> = R[1] }

<external-file-name> ::=
	{file ...} ( owned by <external-file-owner> ) |        ==> { pass 1 }
	{file ...}                                             ==> { NOT_APPLICABLE, - }

<external-file-owner> ::=

	project {<quoted-text-without-subs>} |                 ==> { TRUE, - }
	...                                                    ==> @<Issue PM_BadFileOwner problem@>

@<Issue PM_BadFileOwner problem@> =
	StandardProblems::sentence_problem(Task::syntax_tree(), _p_(PM_BadFileOwner),
		"the owner of this file is wrongly specified",
		"since it is not one of the three possibilities - "
		"(1) Specify nothing: making the file belong to this "
		"project. (2) Specify only that it belongs to someone, "
		"without saying whom: 'The File of Wisdom (owned by "

@ The object phrase is simply quoted text. Although the Preform grammar doesn't
go into this level of detail, it's actually required to have 3 to 23 English
letters or digits, with the first being a letter.

	<new-file-sentence-object-unarticled>                         ==> { pass 1 }

<new-file-sentence-object-unarticled> ::=
	called <np-unparsed>                                          ==> { TRUE, RP[1] }

<nounphrase-external-file> ::=
