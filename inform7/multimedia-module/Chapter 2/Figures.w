[Figures::] Figures.

To register the names associated with picture resource numbers, which are defined
to allow the final story file to show illustrations.

@ The following is called to activate the feature:

#pragma clang diagnostic push
#pragma clang diagnostic ignored "-Wincompatible-function-pointer-types-strict"
	PluginCalls::plug(MAKE_SPECIAL_MEANINGS_PLUG, Figures::make_special_meanings);

@h One special meaning.
We add one special meaning for assertions, to catch sentences with the shape
"Figure... is the file...".

=
int Figures::make_special_meanings(void) {
	SpecialMeanings::declare(Figures::new_figure_SMF, I"new-figure", 2);

@ And this is the Preform grammar needed:

=
<new-figure-sentence-object> ::=

<nounphrase-figure> ::=
	figure ...                           ==> { 0, Diagrams::new_UNPARSED_NOUN(W) }

<figure-sentence-object> ::=
	<figure-source> ( <quoted-text> ) |  ==> { R[1], -, <<alttext>> = R[2] }

<figure-source> ::=
	of cover art |                       ==> { -1, - }
	<quoted-text> |                      ==> { pass 1 }
	...                                  ==> @<Issue PM_PictureNotTextual problem@>;

	==> { 0, - };

@ This is a figure name which Inform provides special support for; it recognises
the English name when it is defined by the Standard Rules. (So there is no need
to translate this to other languages.)

@ In assertion pass 1, then, the following is called on any sentence which
has been found to create a figure:
