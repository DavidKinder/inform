[Map::] The Map.

A feature to provide a geographical model, linking rooms and doors
together in oppositely-paired directions.

@h Introduction.
The map is a complicated data structure, both because it amounts to a
ternary relation (though being implemented by many binary ones) and because
of an ambiguity: a map connection from a room R can lead to another room S,
to a door, or to nothing. Doors come in two sorts, one and two-sided, and
checking the physical realism of all this means we need to produce many
quite specific problem messages.

@h The direction inference.
While we could probably represent map knowledge using relation inferences
in connection with the "mapped D of" relations, it's altogether easier and
makes for more legible code if we use a special inference family of our own:

= (early code)
inference_family *direction_inf = NULL; /* where do map connections from O lead? */

@ =
void Map::create_inference(void) {
	direction_inf = Inferences::new_family(I"direction_inf");
	METHOD_ADD(direction_inf, LOG_DETAILS_INF_MTID, Map::log_direction_inf);
	METHOD_ADD(direction_inf, COMPARE_INF_MTID, Map::cmp_direction_inf);
}

typedef struct direction_inference_data {
	struct inference_subject *to;
	struct inference_subject *dir;
	CLASS_DEFINITION
} direction_inference_data;

	inference_subject *infs_to, instance *o_dir) {
	PROTECTED_MODEL_PROCEDURE;
	direction_inference_data *data = CREATE(direction_inference_data);
	data->to = infs_to;
	data->dir = (o_dir)?(Instances::as_subject(o_dir)):NULL;
	return Inferences::create_inference(direction_inf,
		STORE_POINTER_direction_inference_data(data), prevailing_mood);
}

void Map::infer_direction(inference_subject *infs_from, inference_subject *infs_to,
	instance *o_dir) { 
	inference *i = Map::new_direction_inference(infs_from, infs_to, o_dir);
	Inferences::join_inference(i, infs_from);
}

void Map::log_direction_inf(inference_family *f, inference *inf) {
	direction_inference_data *data = RETRIEVE_POINTER_direction_inference_data(inf->data);

}

@ Inferences about different directions from a location are different topics;
but different destinations in the same direction are different in content.

		internal_error("not a direction inf");
	direction_inference_data *data = RETRIEVE_POINTER_direction_inference_data(i->data);
	if (infs1) *infs1 = data->to; if (infs2) *infs2 = data->dir;

@h Special kinds.
It's obvious why the kinds direction and door are special.

= (early code)
kind *K_direction = NULL;

@ These are recognised by the English name when defined by the Standard
Rules. (So there is no need to translate this to other languages.)

		}
	}
	return FALSE;

@ =
int Map::object_is_a_direction(instance *I) {
	if ((K_direction) && (I) && (Instances::of_kind(I, K_direction))) return TRUE;
	return FALSE;
}

@ Direction needs to be an abstract object, not a thing or a room, so:

@h Spotting directions and doors.

	return FALSE;
}

@h Directions and their numbers.
Directions play a special role because sentences like "east of the treehouse
is the garden" are parsed differently from sentences like "the nearby place
property of the treehouse is the garden".

For reasons to do with creating direction mapping relations, the lengths of
direction names are capped, though very, very few Inform users have ever
realised this:

@d MAX_WORDS_IN_DIRECTION (MAX_WORDS_IN_ASSEMBLAGE - 4)

@ When a new direction comes into existence (i.e., not when the underlying
instance |I| is created, but when its kind is realised to be "direction"),
we will assign it a number:

=
int registered_directions = 0; /* next direction number to be free */

int Map::number_of_directions(void) {
	return registered_directions;
}

@ "Up" and "down" are not really special among possible direction instances, but
they have linguistic features not shared by lateral directions. "Above the
garden is the treehouse", for instance, does not directly refer to either
direction, but implies both.

= (early code)
instance *I_up = NULL;
instance *I_down = NULL;

@ These are recognised by their English names when defined by the Standard Rules.
(So there is no need to translate this to other languages.)

=
<notable-map-directions> ::=
	up |
	down

@ =
int Map::set_kind_notify(instance *I, kind *k) {
	kind *kw = Instances::to_kind(I);
	if ((!(Kinds::Behaviour::is_object_of_kind(kw, K_direction))) &&
		(Kinds::Behaviour::is_object_of_kind(k, K_direction))) {
		wording IW = Instances::get_name(I, FALSE);
		@<Vet the direction name for acceptability@>;
		if (<notable-map-directions>(IW)) {
			switch (<<r>>) {
				case 0: I_up = I; break;

	return FALSE;
}

@<Vet the direction name for acceptability@> =
	if (Wordings::empty(IW)) {
		StandardProblems::sentence_problem(Task::syntax_tree(), _p_(PM_NamelessDirection),
			"nameless directions are not allowed",
			"so writing something like 'There is a direction.' is forbidden.");
		return TRUE;
	}

@h Map data on instances.
The following structure weighs several hundred bytes. If we expected very
large numbers of instances then it might be worth economising here, but
profiling suggests that it really isn't.

@d MAP_DATA(I) FEATURE_DATA_ON_INSTANCE(map, I)
@d MAP_EXIT(X, Y) MAP_DATA(X)->exits[Y]

}

@ Special properties. 
These are property names to do with mapping which Inform provides special
support for. Two are visible to I7 authors, and the others are low-level
properties needed for the run-time implementation.

= (early code)
property *P_other_side = NULL; /* a value property for the other side of a door */
property *P_opposite = NULL; /* a value property for the reverse of a direction */

property *P_door = NULL; /* Inter only */
property *P_door_dir = NULL; /* Inter only */
property *P_door_to = NULL; /* Inter only */
property *P_room_index = NULL; /* Inter only: workspace for path-finding through the map */
property *P_found_in = NULL; /* Inter only: needed for multiply-present objects */

@ We recognise these by their English names when they are defined by the
Standard Rules. (So there is no need to translate this to other languages.)

=
<notable-map-properties> ::=
	opposite |
	leading-through destination

@ =
int Map::new_property_notify(property *prn) {
	if (<notable-map-properties>(prn->name)) {
		switch (<<r>>) {
			case 0: P_opposite = prn; break;
			case 1: P_other_side = prn; break;
		}
	}
	return FALSE;
}

@ The following is used also by //Backdrops//, since both features use a
shared Inter-level property at run-time. But this function will work even if
the map feature is inactive; so you can still have backdrops without a map.

=
void Map::set_found_in(instance *I, parse_node *val) {
	if (P_found_in == NULL)
		P_found_in = ValueProperties::new_nameless(I"found_in",
			K_value);
	if (PropertyInferences::value_of(
		Instances::as_subject(I), P_found_in))
			internal_error("rival found_in interpretations");
	ValueProperties::assert(P_found_in, Instances::as_subject(I), val, CERTAIN_CE);
}

@ This utility returns the "opposite" property for a direction, which is
always another direction: for example, the opposite of northwest is southeast.

=
instance *Map::get_value_of_opposite_property(instance *I) {
	parse_node *val = PropertyInferences::value_of(
		Instances::as_subject(I), P_opposite);
	if (val) return Rvalues::to_object_instance(val);
	return NULL;
}

@h The exits array.
The bulk of the map is stored in the arrays called |exits|, which hold the
map connections fanning out from each room. The direction numbers carefully
noted above are keys into these arrays.

It might look a little wasteful of I7's memory to expand the direction
inferences, a nicely compact representation, into large and sparse arrays.
But it's convenient, and profiling suggests that the memory overhead is not
significant.

=
void Map::build_exits_array(void) {
	instance *I;
	int d = 0;
	LOOP_OVER_INSTANCES(I, K_object) {
		if (Kinds::Behaviour::is_object_of_kind(Instances::to_kind(I), K_direction)) {
			MAP_DATA(I)->direction_index = d++;
		}
	}
	LOOP_OVER_INSTANCES(I, K_object) {
		inference *inf;
		POSITIVE_KNOWLEDGE_LOOP(inf, Instances::as_subject(I), direction_inf) {
			inference_subject *infs1, *infs2;
			Map::get_map_references(inf, &infs1, &infs2);
			instance *to = NULL, *dir = NULL;
			if (infs1) to = InstanceSubjects::to_object_instance(infs1);
			if (infs2) dir = InstanceSubjects::to_object_instance(infs2);
			if ((to) && (dir)) {
				int dn = MAP_DATA(dir)->direction_index;
				if ((dn >= 0) && (dn < MAX_DIRECTIONS)) {
					MAP_EXIT(I, dn) = to;
					MAP_DATA(I)->exits_set_at[dn] = Inferences::where_inferred(inf);
				}
			}
		}
	}
}

@h Door connectivity.
We've seen how most of the map is represented, in the |exits| arrays. The
missing information has to do with doors. If east of the Carousel Room is
the oak door, then |Map_Storage| reveals only that fact, and not what's on
the other side of the door. This will eventually be compiled into the
|door_to| property for the oak door object.

We would like to deduce from a sentence like

>> The other side of the iron door is the Black Holding Area.

that the "Black Holding Area" is a room; otherwise, if it has no map
connections, Inform may well think it's just a thing. This is where that
deduction is made:

=
int Map::inference_drawn(inference *I, inference_subject *subj) {
	property *prn = PropertyInferences::get_property(I);
	if ((prn) && (prn == P_other_side)) {
		parse_node *val = PropertyInferences::get_value(I);
		instance *I = Rvalues::to_object_instance(val);
		if (I) SpatialInferences::infer_is_room(Instances::as_subject(I), CERTAIN_CE);
	}
	return FALSE;
}

@h Linguistic extras.
These NPs allow us to refer to the special directions "up" and "down":

=
<notable-map-noun-phrases> ::=
	below |
	above

@ =
int Map::act_on_special_NPs(parse_node *p) {
	if (<notable-map-noun-phrases>(Node::get_text(p))) {
		switch (<<r>>) {
			case 0:
				if (I_down) {
					Refiner::give_subject_to_noun(p, Instances::as_subject(I_down));
					return TRUE;
				}
				break;
			case 1:
				if (I_up) {
					Refiner::give_subject_to_noun(p, Instances::as_subject(I_up));
					return TRUE;
				}
				break;
		}
	}
	return FALSE;
}

@ Consider the sentences:

>> A dead end is a kind of room. The Pitch is a room. East is a dead end.

Inform would ordinarily read the third sentence as saying that the "east"
object (a direction) has kind "dead end", and would throw a problem message.

What was actually meant, of course, is that a new instance of "dead end"
exists to the east of the Pitch; in effect, we read it as:

>> Z is a dead end. East is Z.

where Z is a newly created and nameless object.

But we must be careful not to catch "East is a direction" in the same net
because, of course, that does set its kind.

=

	if ((Node::get_type(px) == PROPER_NOUN_NT) &&
		(Node::get_type(py) == COMMON_NOUN_NT)) {

	}
	return FALSE;
}

@h The map-connector.
Now we come to the code which creates map connections. This needs special
treatment only so that asserting $M(X, Y)$ also asserts $M'(Y, X)$, where
$M'$ is the predicate for the opposite direction to $M$; but since this
is only a guess, it drops from |CERTAIN_CE| to merely |LIKELY_CE|.

However, the map-connector can also run in one-way mode, where it doesn't
make this guess; so we begin with switching in and out.

void Map::enter_one_way_mode(void) { oneway_map_connections_only = TRUE; }
void Map::exit_one_way_mode(void) { oneway_map_connections_only = FALSE; }

@ Note that, in order to make the conjectural reverse map direction, we need
to look up the "opposite" property of the forward one. This relies on all
directions having their opposites defined before any map is built, and is the
reason for Inform's insistence that directions are always created in matched
pairs.

@ The Spatial model requires that rooms are free-standing, that is, not in, on
or part of anything else; but it knows nothing of doors. So if we are not
careful, the source text could put a door on a shelf, or make it part of a
robot, or something like that. (Testing showed, in fact, that some authors
actually wanted to do this, though the result was a horribly inconsistent
model at run-time.) This is where we apply the kill-joy rule in question:

@ We don't need to do the following for two-sided doors since they will bypass

@ At this point we know that the doors are correctly plumbed in, and all we
need to do is compile properties to implement them. See the DM4 for details
of how to compile one and two-sided doors in I6. Alternatively, take it on

@ The reversal of direction here looks peculiar, but is correct. Suppose
the Drainage Room contains a one-sided door called the iron grating, and
the iron grating is east of the Drainage Room. To get through, the player
will type EAST. But that means the iron grating has one exit, west to the
Drainage Room; so Inform looks at this exit, reverses west to east, and
compiles east into the |door_dir| property.

As for what lies beyond the iron grating, that's stored in the "other side"
property for the door; "other side" is an alias for |door_to|, which is
why we don't need to compile |door_to| here.
