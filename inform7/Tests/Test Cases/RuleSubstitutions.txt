Lab is a room.
The box is in the Lab.

Before doing anything when the player does not carry the box (this is the yow rule): say "yow."

This is the zow rule: say "zow.".

Every turn (this is the kow rule): say "kow."

This is the pow rule: say "pow."

The zow rule substitutes for the yow rule when the player carries the box.

The pow rule substitutes for the kow rule.

Test me with "z / get box / z / drop box / z".
