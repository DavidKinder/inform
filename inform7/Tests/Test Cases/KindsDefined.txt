Castle Zenda is a room.

A monster is a kind of person.

Some kinds of monster are defined by the Table of Monstrous Beasts.

Table of Monstrous Beasts
name	strength	hand-to-hand combat method
goblin	5	"pummeling its green fists"
gnome	2	"slapping its feeble arms"
centaur	9	"kicking its hooves"

In Zenda is a goblin called Arggg. Three centaurs are in Zenda. A gnome called Jira is in Zenda.

Instead of attacking a monster (called the opponent):
	say "Boldly, you declare: 'Ho, [opponent]! I see your strength [strength of opponent]!' It begins [hand-to-hand combat method of opponent].";

Test me with "attack arggg / attack centaur / attack jira".
