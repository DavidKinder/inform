Include Directorial Testing by Araminta Intest.

Laboratory is a room.

A room has a colour called colour scheme.

After looking: say "The wallpaper has a somewhat [colour scheme of the location] tint."

Definition: A colour (called C) is valid if the sequence number of C is not 0.

When play begins:
	say "This is an uninitialised colour variable - ";
	let C be a colour;
	showme C;
	say "Iterating...";
	repeat with D running through colours:
		showme D;
		showme the colour after D;
		showme the colour before D;
		showme the sequence number of D;
		showme the numerical value of D;
		showme whether or not D is valid;
	say "Done.";
	say "Now for a limited-span repeat...";
	repeat with D running from red to purple:
		showme D;
	say "Done.";
	showme the list of colours;
	showme the first value of colour;
	showme the last value of colour;
	showme the colour scheme of the Laboratory;
	say "This tests bracket-plus...";
	test out bracket-plus;
	say "Now for some random values...";
	repeat with N running from 1 to 100:
		say "[a random colour]; ";
	say "... enough!";
	repeat with N running from 1 to 100:
		say "[a random colour from red to purple]; ";
	say "... enough!";

To test out bracket-plus: (-
	TestFunction();
	print MAUVE_COL, " = ", (+ chartreusey lavender +), "^";
-).
