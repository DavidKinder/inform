The Kitchen is a room.

A wallet is a kind of value.
1.0 € specifies a wallet.
1.0€ specifies a wallet.

A resistance is a kind of value.
1.0Ω specifies a resistance.
1.0mΩ specifies a resistance scaled down by 1000.
1.0μΩ specifies a resistance scaled down by 1000000.

A sign is in the Kitchen.

Check examining the sign:
	let C be 2.0 €;
	now C is C plus 0.5€;
	instead say "Bananas: 2.5 € is [C].";

Counting is an action applying to one wallet.
Understand "count [wallet]" as counting.

Report counting:
	say "You count [the wallet understood]."

Resisting is an action applying to one resistance.
Understand "resist [resistance]" as resisting.

Report resisting:
	say "The resistance is [the resistance understood]";
	if the resistance understood is less than 0.5mΩ:
		say ", which is useless";
	instead say ".";

Test me with "x sign / count 1.5 € / count 2€ / count 1.0x10^2 € / count 34x10^-1€ / resist 1Ω / resist 2000mΩ / resist 1mΩ / resist 1000μΩ / resist 0.3mΩ / resist 300μΩ / resist 2μΩ".
