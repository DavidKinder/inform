The Kitchen is a room.

The rock is in the Kitchen. The description is "It's a rock."

Understand "⠗⠕⠉⠅" as the rock.

After reading a command: 
	if the player's command includes "please": 
		say "Please do not say please."; 
		reject the player's command;
	if the player's command includes "excuse me":
		change the text of the player's command to "⠚⠥⠍⠏";
	if the player's command includes "element [number]":
		say "Matched '[matched text]' in '[player's command]'...";
		replace the matched text with "⠗⠕⠉⠅";
		say "... now '[player's command]'...";

Understand "⠚⠥⠍⠏" as jumping.

Test me with "please go away / now excuse me / examine element 12 / get ⠗⠕⠅ / oops ⠗⠕⠉⠅".
