  >--> You wrote 'now the machines are open and the player is in the Dock' (source
    text, line 4), but 'now' does not work with the condition 'machines are
    open and the player is in the Dock' because it can only make one wish come
    true at a time: so it doesn't like the 'and'. Try rewriting as two 'now's
    in a row?
Inform 7 has finished.
