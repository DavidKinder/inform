  >--> The phrase 'To decide which K is foo (L - a value of kind K) bar (Q - a
    value of kind Z)' (source text, line 4) needs to be used in such a way that
    I know what kinds of values go into it; so I'm not sure how to make sense
    of it from 'Foo {{1}} bar {}' (source text, line 3).

  >--> You wrote 'add 0 to Q' (source text, line 5), which I tried to match
    against several possible phrase definitions. None of them worked.
    1.  add (0 - list of Ks) to (q - list of Ks) 
    2.  add (0 - K) to (q - list of Ks) 
    I recognised:
    q = a temporary named value, holding a list of nothing

  >--> You wrote 'add "" to Q' (source text, line 6), which I tried to match
    against several possible phrase definitions. None of them worked.
    1.  add ("" - list of Ks) to (q - list of Ks) 
    2.  add ("" - K) to (q - list of Ks) 
    I recognised:
    q = a temporary named value, holding a list of nothing
