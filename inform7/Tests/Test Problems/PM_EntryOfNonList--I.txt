Problem__ PM_EntryOfNonList
  >--> You wrote 'let N be entry 3 of K' (source text, line 5): but that
    doesn't make sense to me as a list entry, since the entry is taken from
    something which isn't a list.
    I was trying to match one of these phrases:
    1.  let (n - a new name) be (entry 3 of k - description of relations of Ks to
    Ls) 
    2.  let (n - a new name) be (entry 3 of k - name of kind) 
    3.  let (n - a new name) be (entry 3 of k - value) 
    4.  let (n - a temporary named value) be (entry 3 of k - value) 
    I recognised:
    entry 3 of k = a list entry, holding a value
    The name 'n' doesn't yet exist.
Inform 7 has finished.
