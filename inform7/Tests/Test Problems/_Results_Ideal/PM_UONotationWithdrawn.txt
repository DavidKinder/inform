Problem__ PM_UONotationWithdrawn
  >--> In 'Use crazy paving translates as (- Property crazed; -)' (source text, line 3),
    you set up a use option, but you use the deprecated notation '(- Property
    crazed; -)' to say what to do if this option is set. For now, that still
    works if a simple form is used, such as '(- Constant X; -)' or '(- Constant
    Y = {N}; -)' or even '(- Constant Z = 2*{N}; -)', but the ability to write
    arbitrary Inform 6-syntax code here has been withdrawn.
Inform 7 has finished.
