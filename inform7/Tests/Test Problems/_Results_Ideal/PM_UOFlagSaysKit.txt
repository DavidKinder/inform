  >--> In 'Use banana bread translates as configuration value SERIAL_COMMA = 6
    in BasicInformKit' (source text, line 3), you set up a use option used to
    configure the kit 'BasicInformKit' by setting the value of 'SERIAL_COMMA',
    but the JSON metadata for that kit says that SERIAL_COMMA is a flag, and
    here we seem to want to set it to the value 6, which is clearly not 0 or 1.
Inform 7 has finished.
