  >--> You wrote 'A person is a kind of room' (source text, line 2), but that
    seems to contradict 'A person is a kind of thing' (the Standard Rules, line 129),
    as a room and a thing are incompatible. (If a room were a kind of a thing
    or vice versa there'd be no problem, but they aren't.)
Inform 7 has finished.
