Problem__ PM_UseTranslatesNotI6
  >--> You wrote 'Use My First Thing translates as (- Constant FOO; -) Use My
    Second Thing translates as (- Constant BAR; -)' (source text, line 3): but
    that translates into something I don't recognise, which should be
    'configuration flag/value NAME', 'configuration flag/value NAME in KIT', or
    an inline I6-syntax code inclusion in '(-' and '-)' markers, although the
    latter is best avoided.
Inform 7 has finished.
