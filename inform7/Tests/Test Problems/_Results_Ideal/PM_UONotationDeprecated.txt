Problem__ PM_UONotationDeprecated
  >--> In 'Use crazy paving translates as (- Constant CRAZY_PAVING; -)' (source
    text, line 3), you set up a use option, but you use the deprecated notation
    '(- ... -)' to say what to do if this option is set. Since you also have
    'Use no deprecated features' set, I'm issuing a problem message. (For now,
    though, this would have worked if it hadn't been for 'Use no deprecated
    features'.)
Inform 7 has finished.
