  >--> In 'Use slimy hide translates as the configuration value FROG_HIDE = 2' (source
    text, line 4), you set a use option 'slimy hide', but that conflicts with
    the earlier setting 'Use scaly hide translates as the configuration value
    FROG_HIDE = 1' (source text, line 3) of 'scaly hide', because these are
    names for two different possible values of the same parameter.
