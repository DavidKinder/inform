Problem__ PM_UONotInKit
  >--> In 'Use frog count translates as the configuration flag FROG_COUNT in
    BasicInformKit' (source text, line 3), you set up a use option used to
    configure the kit 'BasicInformKit' by setting the value of 'FROG_COUNT',
    but that kit (though part of the current project) has no such configuration
    value. These are set for a kit in its JSON metadata file.
Inform 7 has finished.
