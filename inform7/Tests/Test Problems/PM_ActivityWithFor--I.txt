Problem__ PM_ActivityWithFor
  >--> In the sentence 'carry out the peering for activity with 2' (source text, line 7),
    I was expecting to read an activity, but instead found some text that I
    couldn't understand - 'peering for'. Were you by any chance meaning to
    refer to an activity by name, and used the word 'for' at the end of that
    name? If so, try removing just the word 'for'.
    I was trying to match this phrase:
      carry out the (peering for - activity on Ks) activity with (2 - K) 
    But I didn't recognise 'peering for'.
Inform 7 has finished.
