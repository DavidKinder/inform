  >--> In the sentence 'let X be the tree condition' (source text, line 7), I
    was expecting to read a value, but instead found some text that I couldn't
    understand - 'tree condition'. Names which end in 'condition' often
    represent the current state of something which can be in any one of three
    or more states. Names like this only work if you've declared them, with a
    line like 'The rocket is either dry, fuelled or launched.' - in which case
    the value 'rocket condition' will always be one of 'dry', 'fuelled' or
    'launched'. Maybe you forgot to declare something like this, or mis-spelled
    the name of the owner?
    I was trying to match one of these phrases:
    1.  let (x - a new name) be (tree condition - description of relations of Ks
    to Ls) 
    2.  let (x - a new name) be (tree condition - name of kind) 
    3.  let (x - a new name) be (tree condition - value) 
    4.  let (x - a temporary named value) be (tree condition - value) 
    But I didn't recognise 'tree condition'.
    The name 'x' doesn't yet exist.
Inform 7 has finished.
