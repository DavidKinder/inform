Problem__ PM_LookedUpForbiddenProperty
  >--> In the sentence 'let M be the carrying capacity of the Entire Game' (source
    text, line 4), you seem to be looking up the 'carrying capacity' property,
    but 'Entire Game' is not allowed to have that property.
    I was trying to match one of these phrases:
    1.  let (m - a new name) be (carrying capacity of the entire game - description
    of relations of Ks to Ls) 
    2.  let (m - a new name) be (carrying capacity of the entire game - name of
    kind) 
    3.  let (m - a new name) be (carrying capacity of the entire game - value)
    
    4.  let (m - a temporary named value) be (carrying capacity of the entire
    game - value) 
    I recognised:
    carrying capacity of the entire game = a property whose value is a number,
    holding a number
    The name 'm' doesn't yet exist.
Inform 7 has finished.
