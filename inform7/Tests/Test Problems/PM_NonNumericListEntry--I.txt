Problem__ PM_NonNumericListEntry
  >--> You wrote 'let M be entry "three" of L' (source text, line 5): but that
    doesn't make sense to me as a list entry, because the indication of which
    entry is not a number. For instance, 'entry 3 of L' is allowed, but not
    'entry "six" of L'. (List entries are numbered 1, 2, 3, ...)
    I was trying to match one of these phrases:
    1.  let (m - a new name) be (entry "three" of l - description of relations of
    Ks to Ls) 
    2.  let (m - a new name) be (entry "three" of l - name of kind) 
    3.  let (m - a new name) be (entry "three" of l - value) 
    4.  let (m - a temporary named value) be (entry "three" of l - value) 
    I recognised:
    entry "three" of l = a list entry, holding a number
    The name 'm' doesn't yet exist.
Inform 7 has finished.
