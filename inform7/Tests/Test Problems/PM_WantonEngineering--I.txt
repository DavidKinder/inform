  >--> In 'let x be 1.7E6' (source text, line 4), you write '1.7E6', which
    looks to me like the engineering notation for a real number - I'm guessing
    that the 'e' means exponent, so for example, 1E+6 means 1000000. Inform
    writes numbers like this as 1 x 10^6, or if you prefer 1.0 x 10^6; or you
    can use a multiplication sign instead of the 'x'.
    I was trying to match one of these phrases:
    1.  let (x - a new name) be (1.7e6 - description of relations of Ks to
    Ls) 
    2.  let (x - a new name) be (1.7e6 - name of kind) 
    3.  let (x - a new name) be (1.7e6 - value) 
    4.  let (x - a temporary named value) be (1.7e6 - value) 
    I recognised:
    1.7e6 = a real number
    The name 'x' doesn't yet exist.
     Note that Inform's kinds 'number' and 'real number' are not
    interchangeable. A 'number' like 7 can be used where a 'real number' is
    expected - it becomes 7.000 - but not vice versa. Use 'R to the nearest
    whole number' if you want to make a conversion.
Inform 7 has finished.
