  >--> In 'let x be 1000' (source text, line 3), it looks as if you want to use
    'let' to change the value of the temporary variable 'x'. Ordinarily that
    would be fine, but it's not allowed when the variable is used as the
    counter in a 'repeat' loop, or has some other do-not-disturb purpose - this
    could cause chaotic effects. The rule is: you can only change an existing
    value with 'let' if it was created by 'let' in the first place.

    Ls) 
    2.  let (x - a new name) be (1000 - name of kind) 
    3.  let (x - a new name) be (1000 - value) 
    4.  let (x - a temporary named value) be (1000 - value)
