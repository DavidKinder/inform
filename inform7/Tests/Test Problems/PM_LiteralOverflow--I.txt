  >--> You wrote 'let F be given by F = 12345678901234, where F is a number' (source
    text, line 4): but you use a number which is too large, at least with the
    Settings for this project as they currently are. (Change to Glulx to be
    allowed to use much larger numbers.)
    I was trying to match one of these phrases:
    1.  let (f - a new name) be given by (f = 12345678901234 , where f is a
    number - equation name) 
    2.  let (f - a temporary named value) be given by (f = 12345678901234 , where
    f is a number - equation name) 
    3.  let (f - a new name) be (given by f = 12345678901234 , where f is a
    number - description of relations of Ks to Ls) 
    4.  let (f - a new name) be (given by f = 12345678901234 , where f is a
    number - name of kind) 
    5.  let (f - a new name) be (given by f = 12345678901234 , where f is a
    number - value) 
    6.  let (f - a temporary named value) be (given by f = 12345678901234 , where
    f is a number - value) 
    I recognised:
    f = 12345678901234 , where f is a number = an equation name
    But I didn't recognise 'given by f = 12345678901234 , where f is a
    number'.
    The name 'f' doesn't yet exist.
Inform 7 has finished.
