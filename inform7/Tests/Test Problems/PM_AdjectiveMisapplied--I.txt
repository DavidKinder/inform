  >--> In the sentence 'now the Laboratory is empty' (source text, line 4), it
    looks as if you intend 'Laboratory is empty' to be a condition, but that
    seems to involve applying the adjective 'empty' to a room - and I have no
    definition of it which would apply in that situation. (Try looking it up in
    the Lexicon part of the Phrasebook index to see what definition(s) 'empty'
    has.)
    I was trying to match this phrase:
      now (laboratory is empty - a condition) 
    I recognised:
    laboratory is empty = a condition
