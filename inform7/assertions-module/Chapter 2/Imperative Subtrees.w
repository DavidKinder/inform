[ImperativeSubtrees::] Imperative Subtrees.

To tidy up blocks of rule and phrase definition in the syntax tree.

@ Blocks of imperative code in Inform 7 source text enter the syntax tree
at |IMPERATIVE_NT| nodes: some define phrases, some define rules. Those nodes
are initially followed by a run of |UNKNOWN_NT| nodes for the actual code.
The process of "acceptance" turns such definitions into a subtree, as
follows:
= (text)
IMPERATIVE_NT 'every turn'                IMPERATIVE_NT 'every turn
UNKNOWN_NT 'say "Hello!"'            -->      INVOCATION_LIST_NT 'say "Hello!"'
UNKNOWN_NT 'now the guard is alert'           INVOCATION_LIST_NT 'now the guard is alert'
=
//ImperativeSubtrees::accept// needs to be called on every |IMPERATIVE_NT| node in order
for this to work; note that it does nothing further, but also causes no harm,
if called multiple times on the same node. //ImperativeSubtrees::accept_all// can
therefore safely be used to sweep up any |IMPERATIVE_NT| nodes not already processed.

=
void ImperativeSubtrees::accept_all(void) {
	if (problem_count > 0) return; /* for then the tree is perhaps broken anyway */
	SyntaxTree::traverse(Task::syntax_tree(), ImperativeSubtrees::accept);
}

void ImperativeSubtrees::accept(parse_node *p) {
	ImperativeSubtrees::accept_inner(p, TRUE);
}
void ImperativeSubtrees::accept_body(parse_node *p) {
	ImperativeSubtrees::accept_inner(p, FALSE);
}

void ImperativeSubtrees::accept_inner(parse_node *p, int accept_header) {
	if ((Node::get_type(p) == IMPERATIVE_NT) && (p->down == NULL)) {
		if (Node::get_impdef(p)) return;
		parse_node *header = p;
		parse_node *end_def = p;
		while ((end_def->next) && (Node::get_type(end_def->next) == UNKNOWN_NT))
			end_def = end_def->next;
		if (header != end_def) {
			/* splice so that |p->next| to |end_def| become the children of |p|: */
			p->down = p->next;
			p->next = end_def->next;
			end_def->next = NULL;
			for (parse_node *inv_p = p->down; inv_p; inv_p = inv_p->next)
				InvocationLists::make_into_list_node(inv_p);
			@<Parse the structure of the code block@>;
		}
		/* worry about the preamble in the node p */
		if (accept_header)
			Node::set_impdef(header,
				ImperativeDefinitions::new(header));
	}
}

@ After acceptance, and therefore exactly once, the structure of the code in
the definition is parsed and checked for sanity.

Though it is now a historical relic, Inform has two different syntaxes for
blocks of code: "colon syntax", introduced in March 2008, which uses Python-like
colons and indentation to show structural subdivision; and "begin/end syntax",
which uses explicit marker phrases like "end if" and "end while". The compiler
continues to support both though they cannot be mixed in a single |IMPERATIVE_NT|
subtree.

The old syntax is retained not for compatibility with old code -- very little
remains from the pre-2008 era which has not been modernised -- but because
some partially sighted users find tabbed indentation difficult to manage
with screen-readers.

Here, then, we must work out which syntax is used, decipher it, and turn the
list into a proper tree structure in a single unified format. We will also
try to find and report as many problems as we can which are due to code blocks
being improperly opened or closed, because punctuation errors in rules are
one of the biggest sources of beginners' difficulties with Inform, and we want
to catch and report these problems early.

This means looking out for control structures such as "if" and "while": see
//supervisor: Control Structures// for where these are defined.

wrong -- it means indentation has jumped inward as if to open a new block,
but blocks are opened explicitly and not by simply raising the indent.
But when |indent| is less than we expect, this may simply mean that the

@ A long-standing annoyance in Inform syntax was that commas were not allowed
inside text substitutions: |"Like [this, that]."| The reason for this was that
such a text converts to the say phrase |say "Like ", this, that, "."|; so that
what was intended as a single expression with a comma in |this, that| came out
as two, |this| then |that|. This arose seldom, but meant that phrases using
phrase options, which unhappily include a comma in their syntax, could not
easily be used in substitutions.

The text now converts to |say "Like ", (this, that), "."|, so that a single
bracketed expression |(this, that)| appears. Thus, round brackets are put
around the contents of any substitution which contains a comma.

@ Something devious happens when text following a "say" is found. Double-quoted text
is literal if it contains no square brackets, but is expanded if it includes text
substitutions in squares. Thus:

>> "Look, [the noun] said."

becomes:

>> "Look, ", the noun, " said."

This is then re-parsed with the following nonterminal; note that we report any
problem with misuse of commas -- really, of square brackets -- before handing back
to <s-say-phrase> to parse the list.

=
<verify-expanded-text-substitution> ::=
	*** . *** |    ==> @<Issue PM_TSWithPunctuation problem@>; ==> { fail };
	, *** |        ==> @<Issue PM_EmptySubstitution problem@>; ==> { fail };
	*** , |        ==> @<Issue PM_EmptySubstitution problem@>; ==> { fail };
	*** , , ***	|  ==> @<Issue PM_EmptySubstitution problem@>; ==> { fail };
	...            ==> { -, - }
