[PluginCalls::] Plugin Calls.

Giving compiler features the ability to install plugin functions.

@ The three Inform compiler tools //inform7//, //inbuild// and //inter//
share a set of named compiler features, managed by //arch: Feature Manager//.
At any given time these can be active or inactive.

In //inform7//, features gain further abilities: they can attach storage to
certain internal data structures, and they can provide plugin functions which
interfere with the normal running of the compiler.

The names of these features are hard-wired into the compiler rather than being
stored in Preform grammar, and they therefore cannot be translated out of
English. But this is intentional. Dependencies on compiler features are managed
by name inside the //supervisor// module, and metadata for projects and kits
refers to those names. So they have to be the same regardless of the language
being used in the project. But it hardly matters, because these names are
invisible to all but the most expert users.

However, because it is possible to have headings in Inform source text which
restrict material according to whether a feature is active, we do need a
Preform nonterminal to parse those names. Here it is:

=
<language-element> internal {
	TEMPORARY_TEXT(T)
	WRITE_TO(T, "%W", W);
	compiler_feature *F = Features::from_name(T);
	DISCARD_TEXT(T)
	if (F) {
		if (F->active == FALSE) {
			==> { FALSE, F };
		} else {
			==> { TRUE, F };
		}
		return TRUE;
	}
	==> { fail nonterminal };
}

@ As noted above, features can provide plugin functions, which go into what
we will call "plugin rulebooks" -- there's a mixed metaphor here, but the idea
is that they behave like Inform rulebooks. When a rulebook is called, the
compiler works through each plug until one of them returns something other
than |FALSE|.

Features should add plugins in their activation functions, by calling
//PluginCalls::plug//, which has an interestingly vague type. The next
screenful of code looks like something of a workout for the C typechecker, but
it compiles under |clang| without even the |-Wpedantic| warning, and honestly
you're barely living as a C programmer if you never generate that one.

=
linked_list *plugin_rulebooks[NO_DEFINED_PLUG_VALUES+1]; /* of |void|, reprehensibly */

void PluginCalls::start(void) {
	for (int i=0; i<=NO_DEFINED_PLUG_VALUES; i++)
		plugin_rulebooks[i] = NEW_LINKED_LIST(void);
}

void PluginCalls::plug(int code, int (*R)()) {
	if (code > NO_DEFINED_PLUG_VALUES) internal_error("not a plugin call");
	void *vR = (void *) R;
	ADD_TO_LINKED_LIST(vR, void, plugin_rulebooks[code]);
}

@ The functions in //Plugin Calls// then make use of these macros, which are
the easiest way to persuade the C typechecker to allow variable arguments to
be passed in a portable way. Similarly, there are two macros not one because
C does not allow a void variable argument list.

We must take care that the variables introduced in the macro body do not mask
existing variables used in the arguments; the only way to do this is to give
them implausible names.

@d PLUGINS_CALL(code, args...) {
	void *R_plugin_pointer_XYZZY; /* no argument can have this name */
	LOOP_OVER_LINKED_LIST(R_plugin_pointer_XYZZY, void, plugin_rulebooks[code]) {
		int (*R_plugin_rule_ZOOGE)() = (int (*)()) R_plugin_pointer_XYZZY; /* or this one */
		int Q_plugin_return_PLUGH = (*R_plugin_rule_ZOOGE)(args); /* or this */
		if (Q_plugin_return_PLUGH) return Q_plugin_return_PLUGH;
	}
	return FALSE;
}

@d PLUGINS_CALLV(code) {
	void *R_plugin_pointer_XYZZY;
	LOOP_OVER_LINKED_LIST(R_plugin_pointer_XYZZY, void, plugin_rulebooks[code]) {
		int (*R_plugin_rule_ZOOGE)() = (int (*)()) R_plugin_pointer_XYZZY;
		int Q_plugin_return_PLUGH = (*R_plugin_rule_ZOOGE)();
		if (Q_plugin_return_PLUGH) return Q_plugin_return_PLUGH;
	}
	return FALSE;
}

@ Nothing can prevent this from being a big old miscellany, so we take them by
compiler module, and within each module in alphabetical order.

@h Influencing core.
Called from //Task::advance_stage_to//. This allows features to run additional
production-line steps in compilation, and that is done mostly at the Inter
generation stage, to add extra arrays or functions needed at runtime.
For example, the mapping feature compiles an array to hold the map during
stage |INTER1_CSEQ|.

Because the following is called at the end of every main stage of compilation
except for |FINISHED_CSEQ|, it is called about 15 times in all, so it is
essential to check |stage| and act only on the right occasion. |debugging| is
|TRUE| if this is a debugging run.

A function attached to this plug should then ideally divide its work up into
major subtasks and call each one with the |BENCH| macro, so that the time it
takes will (if appreciable) be included in the //inform7: Performance Metrics//.

See //How To Compile// for the stages and their |*_CSEQ| numbers.

@e PRODUCTION_LINE_PLUG from 1

=
int PluginCalls::production_line(int stage, int debugging, stopwatch_timer *timer) {
	PLUGINS_CALL(PRODUCTION_LINE_PLUG, stage, debugging, timer);
}

@h Influencing assertions.
Called from //assertions: Refine Parse Tree// to ask if this node is a noun
phrase with special significance: for example, "below" is significant to the
mapping feature. If so, the plugin should set the subject of the node to say
what it refers to, and return |TRUE|.

@e ACT_ON_SPECIAL_NPS_PLUG

=
int PluginCalls::act_on_special_NPs(parse_node *p) {
	PLUGINS_CALL(ACT_ON_SPECIAL_NPS_PLUG, p);
}

@ Called from //assertions: Assemblies//. Body-snatching is used only by the
"player" feature, and is explained there; it handles the consequences of sentences
like "The player is Lord Collingwood".

@e DETECT_BODYSNATCHING_PLUG

=
int PluginCalls::detect_bodysnatching(inference_subject *body, int *snatcher,
	inference_subject **counterpart) {
	PLUGINS_CALL(DETECT_BODYSNATCHING_PLUG, body, snatcher, counterpart);
}

@ Called from //assertions: Assertions// to see if any plugin wants to
intepret a sentence its own way, either taking direct action or issuing a
more nuanced problem message than the usual machinery would have issued.
If so, the plugin should return |TRUE|, which both ensures that no other
plugin intervenes, and also tells //assertions// not to proceed further
with the sentence.

@e INTERVENE_IN_ASSERTION_PLUG

=
int PluginCalls::intervene_in_assertion(parse_node *px, parse_node *py) {
	PLUGINS_CALL(INTERVENE_IN_ASSERTION_PLUG, px, py);
}

@ Called from //assertions: The Creator// when a copular sentence may be
creating something. For example, the actions feature needs this.

@e CREATION_PLUG

=
int PluginCalls::creation(parse_node *px, parse_node *py) {
	PLUGINS_CALL(CREATION_PLUG, px, py);
}

@ Called from //assertions: Assertions// when an unfamiliar node type appears
where a property value might be expected. For example, the actions feature
uses this to deal with setting a property to an |ACTION_NT| node. To
intervene, set the node specification using //assertions: Refine Parse Tree//
and return |TRUE|; or return |FALSE| to let nature take its course.

@e UNUSUAL_PROPERTY_VALUE_PLUG

=
int PluginCalls::unusual_property_value(parse_node *py) {
	PLUGINS_CALL(UNUSUAL_PROPERTY_VALUE_PLUG, py);
}

@ Called from //assertions: The Creator// when an instance is being made in
an assembly, and its name may involve a genitive. For example, if the
assembly says "every person has a nose", then normally this would be called
something like "Mr Rogers's nose"; but the player feature uses the following
to have "your nose" in the case of the player instance.

@e IRREGULAR_GENITIVE_IN_ASSEMBLY_PLUG

=
int PluginCalls::irregular_genitive(inference_subject *owner, text_stream *genitive,
	int *propriety) {
	PLUGINS_CALL(IRREGULAR_GENITIVE_IN_ASSEMBLY_PLUG, owner, genitive, propriety);
}

@ Called from //assertions: Booting Verbs// to give each plugin a chance to
create any special sentence meanings it would like to. For example, the
sounds feature defines a special form of assertion sentence this way. The
plugin should always return |FALSE|, since otherwise it may gazump other
plugins and cause them to stop working.

@e MAKE_SPECIAL_MEANINGS_PLUG

=
int PluginCalls::make_special_meanings(void) {
	PLUGINS_CALLV(MAKE_SPECIAL_MEANINGS_PLUG);
}

@ Called from //assertions: Assertions// when it seems that the author wants
to create a property of something with a sentence like "A container has a
number called security rating." A plugin can intervene and act on that,
returning |TRUE| to stop the usual machinery. For example, the actions
feature does this so that "The going action has a number called celerity"
can be intercepted to create an action variable, not a property.

@e OFFERED_PROPERTY_PLUG

=
int PluginCalls::offered_property(kind *K, parse_node *owner, parse_node *what) {
	PLUGINS_CALL(OFFERED_PROPERTY_PLUG, K, owner, what);
}

@ Called from //assertions: Assertions// when the specification pseudo-variable
is about to be set for something; the plugin can then intercept this.

@e OFFERED_SPECIFICATION_PLUG

=
int PluginCalls::offered_specification(parse_node *owner, wording W) {
	PLUGINS_CALL(OFFERED_SPECIFICATION_PLUG, owner, W);
}

@ Called from //assertions: Refine Parse Tree// to ask plugins if a noun phrase
has a noun implicit within it, even though none is explicitly given. For
example, the player feature uses this to say that "initially carried" means
"...by the player", and sets the subject of the node to be the player character
instance.

@e REFINE_IMPLICIT_NOUN_PLUG

=
int PluginCalls::refine_implicit_noun(parse_node *p) {
	PLUGINS_CALL(REFINE_IMPLICIT_NOUN_PLUG, p);
}

@ Called from //assertions: Classifying Sentences// to give plugins the chance
of an early look at a newly-read assertion. For example, the map feature uses
this to spot that a sentence will create a new direction.

@e NEW_ASSERTION_NOTIFY_PLUG

=
int PluginCalls::new_assertion_notify(parse_node *p) {
	PLUGINS_CALL(NEW_ASSERTION_NOTIFY_PLUG, p);
}

@ Called from //assertions: The Equality Relation Revisited// when we have
to decide if it's valid to ask or declare that two things are the same.
Returning |TRUE| says that it is always valid; returning |FALSE| leaves
it to the regular machinery. This plug can therefore only be used to permit
additional usages, not to restrict existing ones.

@e TYPECHECK_EQUALITY_PLUG

=
int PluginCalls::typecheck_equality(kind *K1, kind *K2) {
	PLUGINS_CALL(TYPECHECK_EQUALITY_PLUG, K1, K2);
}

@ Called from //assertions: Assertions// to warn plugins that a variable
is now being assigned a value by an explicit assertion sentence.

@e VARIABLE_VALUE_NOTIFY_PLUG

=
int PluginCalls::variable_set_warning(nonlocal_variable *q, parse_node *val) {
	PLUGINS_CALL(VARIABLE_VALUE_NOTIFY_PLUG, q, val);
}

@ Called from //assertions: Rule Family// to warn plugins that a new rule
definition has been found in the source text.

@e NEW_RULE_DEFN_NOTIFY_PLUG

=
int PluginCalls::new_rule_defn_notify(imperative_defn *id, rule_family_data *rfd) {
	PLUGINS_CALL(NEW_RULE_DEFN_NOTIFY_PLUG, id, rfd);
}

@ Called from //assertions: Runtime Context Data// to warn plugins that
a new set of runtime context data is being made.

@e NEW_RCD_NOTIFY_PLUG

=
int PluginCalls::new_rcd_notify(id_runtime_context_data *rcd) {
	PLUGINS_CALL(NEW_RCD_NOTIFY_PLUG, rcd);
}

@h Influencing values.
Called from //values: Rvalues// to allow plugins to help decide whether values
of the same kind would be equal if evaluated at runtime. For example, the
scenes feature uses this to determine if two |K_scene| constants are equal.
To make a decision, set |rv| to either |TRUE| or |FALSE| and return |TRUE|.
To make no decision, return |FALSE|.

@e COMPARE_CONSTANT_PLUG

=
int PluginCalls::compare_constant(parse_node *c1, parse_node *c2, int *rv) {
	PLUGINS_CALL(COMPARE_CONSTANT_PLUG, c1, c2, rv);
}

@ Called from //values: Rvalues// to allow plugins to compile rvalues in
eccentric ways of their own: not in fact just for the whimsy of it, but to
make it possible for plugins to support base kinds of their own. For example,
the "actions" plugin needs this to deal with the "stored action" kind.

@e COMPILE_CONSTANT_PLUG

=
int PluginCalls::compile_constant(value_holster *VH, kind *K, parse_node *spec) {
	PLUGINS_CALL(COMPILE_CONSTANT_PLUG, VH, K, spec);
}

@ Called from //values: Conditions// to allow plugins to compile conditions in
their own way. For example, the "actions" plugin needs this to compile matches
of the current action against an action pattern.

@e COMPILE_CONDITION_PLUG

=
int PluginCalls::compile_condition(value_holster *VH, parse_node *spec) {
	PLUGINS_CALL(COMPILE_CONDITION_PLUG, VH, spec);
}

@ Called from //values: Specifications// to ask if there is some reason why
a rule about |I1| should be thought broader in scope than one about |I2|. This
is used by the regions feature when one is a sub-region of the other. This is
expected to behave as a |strcmp|-like sorting function, with a positive
return value saying |I1| is broader, negative |I2|, or zero that they are equal.

@e MORE_SPECIFIC_PLUG

=
int PluginCalls::more_specific(instance *I1, instance *I2) {
	PLUGINS_CALL(MORE_SPECIFIC_PLUG, I1, I2);
}

@ Called from //values: Constants and Descriptions// to give plugins a chance
to parse text which might otherwise be meaningless (or mean something different)
and make it a "composite noun-quantifier" such as "everywhere" or "nothing".
The main compiler does not recognise "everywhere" because it has no concept
of space, but the spatial feature does, and this is how.

@e PARSE_COMPOSITE_NQS_PLUG

=
int PluginCalls::parse_composite_NQs(wording *W, wording *DW,
	quantifier **quantifier_used, kind **some_kind) {
	PLUGINS_CALL(PARSE_COMPOSITE_NQS_PLUG, W, DW, quantifier_used, some_kind);
}

@h Influencing knowledge.
Called from //knowledge: The Model World// to invite the plugin to participate
in stages I to V of the completion process. This may involve using contextual
reasoning to draw further inferences.

@e COMPLETE_MODEL_PLUG

=
int PluginCalls::complete_model(int stage) {
	PLUGINS_CALL(COMPLETE_MODEL_PLUG, stage);
}

@ Called from //knowledge: Inference Subjects// to invite the plugin to
create any additional inference subjects it might want to reason about. In
practice, this tends to be used to create preliminary subjects to stand in
for significant kinds before those kinds are ready to be created.

@e CREATE_INFERENCE_SUBJECTS_PLUG

=
int PluginCalls::create_inference_subjects(void) {
	PLUGINS_CALLV(CREATE_INFERENCE_SUBJECTS_PLUG);
}

@ Called from //knowledge: Indefinite Appearance// to ask the plugins what
inferences, if any, to draw from a double-quoted text standing as an entire
sentence. The |infs| is the subject which was being talked about at the time
the text was quoted, and therefore presumably is what the text should describe.

@e DEFAULT_APPEARANCE_PLUG

=
int PluginCalls::default_appearance(inference_subject *infs, parse_node *txt) {
	PLUGINS_CALL(DEFAULT_APPEARANCE_PLUG, infs, txt);
}

@ Called from //knowledge: Inferences// when an inference is drawn about
something. This does not, of course, necessarily mean that this will actually
be the property of something: the inference might turn out to be mistaken. The
mapping feature uses this to infer further that if something is said to be a
map connection to somewhere else, then it is probably a room.

@e INFERENCE_DRAWN_NOTIFY_PLUG

=
int PluginCalls::inference_drawn(inference *I, inference_subject *subj) {
	PLUGINS_CALL(INFERENCE_DRAWN_NOTIFY_PLUG, I, subj);
}

@ Called from //knowledge: Kind Subjects//. Early in the run, before some kinds
are created, placeholder inference subjects are created to stand in for them;
this call enables plugins to recognise certain texts as referring to those.

@e NAME_TO_EARLY_INFS_PLUG

=
int PluginCalls::name_to_early_infs(wording W, inference_subject **infs) {
	PLUGINS_CALL(NAME_TO_EARLY_INFS_PLUG, W, infs);
}

@ Called from //knowledge: Kind Subjects// to warn plugins about a new kind,
which in practice enables them to spot from the name that it is actually a kind
they want to provide built-in support for: thus the actions feature reacts to
the name "stored action", for example. |K| is the newcomer, |super| its super-kind,
if any; |d| and |W| are alternate forms of that name -- |d| will be useful if the
kind was created by a kit (such as "number"), |W| if it came from Inform 7
source text (such as "container").

@e NEW_BASE_KIND_NOTIFY_PLUG

=
int PluginCalls::new_base_kind_notify(kind *K, kind *super, text_stream *d, wording W) {
	PLUGINS_CALL(NEW_BASE_KIND_NOTIFY_PLUG, K, d, W);
}

@ Called from //knowledge: Instances// to warn plugins that a new instance has
been created. For example, the figures feature needs to know this so that it
can see when a new illustration has been created.

At the time this is called, the exact kind of an instance may not be known,
if that instance is an object: so beware of relying on the kind unless you're
sure you're not dealing with an object.

@e NEW_INSTANCE_NOTIFY_PLUG

=
int PluginCalls::new_named_instance_notify(instance *nc) {
	PLUGINS_CALL(NEW_INSTANCE_NOTIFY_PLUG, nc);
}

@ Called from //knowledge: Property Permissions// to warn plugins that a subject
has been given permission to hold a property; the parsing feature, for example,
uses this to attach a visibility flag.

@e NEW_PERMISSION_NOTIFY_PLUG

=
int PluginCalls::new_permission_notify(property_permission *pp) {
	PLUGINS_CALL(NEW_PERMISSION_NOTIFY_PLUG, pp);
}

@ Called from //knowledge: Properties// to warn plugins that a property has
been created, which they can use to spot properties with special significance
to them.

@e NEW_ACTIVITY_NOTIFY_PLUG

=
int PluginCalls::new_activity_notify(activity *act) {
	PLUGINS_CALL(NEW_ACTIVITY_NOTIFY_PLUG, act);
}

@ Called from //knowledge: Properties// to warn plugins that a property has
been created, which they can use to spot properties with special significance
to them.

@e NEW_PROPERTY_NOTIFY_PLUG

=
int PluginCalls::new_property_notify(property *prn) {
	PLUGINS_CALL(NEW_PROPERTY_NOTIFY_PLUG, prn);
}

@ Called from //knowledge: Inference Subjects// to warn plugins that a subject
has been created, which they can use to spot subjects with special significance
to them.

@e NEW_SUBJECT_NOTIFY_PLUG

=
int PluginCalls::new_subject_notify(inference_subject *subj) {
	PLUGINS_CALL(NEW_SUBJECT_NOTIFY_PLUG, subj);
}

@ Called from //knowledge: Nonlocal Variables// to warn plugins that a new
variable has been created, which they can use to spot variables with special
significance to them.

@e NEW_VARIABLE_NOTIFY_PLUG

=
int PluginCalls::new_variable_notify(nonlocal_variable *q) {
	PLUGINS_CALL(NEW_VARIABLE_NOTIFY_PLUG, q);
}

@ Called from //knowledge: Instances// to warn plugins that the kind of an
instance is about to be set. This happens most often when the instance is
created, but can also happen again, refining the kind to a subkind, when
the instance is an object.

@e SET_KIND_NOTIFY_PLUG

=
int PluginCalls::set_kind_notify(instance *I, kind *k) {
	PLUGINS_CALL(SET_KIND_NOTIFY_PLUG, I, k);
}

@ Called from //knowledge: Kind Subjects// when one kind of object is made a
subkind of another, as for example when "container" is a made a subkind of
"thing". The plugin should return |TRUE| if it wishes to forbid this,
and if so, it had better throw a problem message, or the user will be
mystified.

This can be used to forbid certain kinds having subkinds, as for example the
regions plugin does with the "region" kind.

@e SET_SUBKIND_NOTIFY_PLUG

=
int PluginCalls::set_subkind_notify(kind *sub, kind *super) {
	PLUGINS_CALL(SET_SUBKIND_NOTIFY_PLUG, sub, super);
}

@h Influencing the imperative module.
Called from //assertions: Rule Bookings// to give plugins a chance to move
automatically placed rules from one rulebook to another. The actions feature
uses this to break up what would otherwise be unwieldy before and after
rulebooks into smaller ones for each action.

If making a diversion, the plugin should write the new rulebook into |new_owner|
and return |TRUE|; and otherwise |FALSE|.

@e PLACE_RULE_PLUG

=
int PluginCalls::place_rule(rule *R, rulebook *original_owner, rulebook **new_owner) {
	PLUGINS_CALL(PLACE_RULE_PLUG, R, original_owner, new_owner);
}

@ Called from //assertions: Rulebooks//. This is very similar, but runs in all cases,
and not only for automatic placement.

@e RULE_PLACEMENT_NOTIFY_PLUG

=
int PluginCalls::rule_placement_notify(rule *R, rulebook *original_owner, int side, rule *ref_rule) {
	PLUGINS_CALL(RULE_PLACEMENT_NOTIFY_PLUG, R, original_owner, side, ref_rule);
}

@

@e COMPILE_TEST_HEAD_PLUG

=
int PluginCalls::compile_test_head(id_body *idb, rule *R, int *tests) {
	PLUGINS_CALL(COMPILE_TEST_HEAD_PLUG, idb, R, tests);
}

@

@e COMPILE_TEST_TAIL_PLUG

=
int PluginCalls::compile_test_tail(id_body *idb, rule *R) {
	PLUGINS_CALL(COMPILE_TEST_TAIL_PLUG, idb, R);
}

@ Called from //imperative: Compile Invocations Inline//, but only when an
annotation arises which the regular machinery doesn't know how to handle.
This is currently only used by //if: Timed Rules//.

@e INLINE_ANNOTATION_PLUG

=
int PluginCalls::nonstandard_inline_annotation(int annot, parse_node *supplied) {
	PLUGINS_CALL(INLINE_ANNOTATION_PLUG, annot, supplied);
}

@h Influencing the actions feature.
We now have a whole run of functions called only by the actions feature, and
therefore only when it is active.

Called from //if: Actions Plugin// to signal that a new action has been
created. For example, the going feature uses this to spot the arrival of "going".

@e NEW_ACTION_NOTIFY_PLUG

=
int PluginCalls::new_action_notify(action_name *an) {
	PLUGINS_CALL(NEW_ACTION_NOTIFY_PLUG, an);
}

@ Called from //if: Action Pattern Clauses// to invite plugins to change the
action pattern clause ID associated with a given action variable. This may be
needed in order to cross-reference between multiple such clauses, as with
the going action variables.

@e DIVERT_AP_CLAUSE_PLUG

=
int PluginCalls::divert_AP_clause_ID(shared_variable *stv, int *id) {
	*id = -1;
	PLUGINS_CALL(DIVERT_AP_CLAUSE_PLUG, stv, id);
}

@ Called from //if: Action Pattern Clauses// to ask plugins to print a helpful
name for the debugging log for any new clause ID |C| which they have created.

@e WRITE_AP_CLAUSE_ID_PLUG

=
int PluginCalls::write_AP_clause_ID(OUTPUT_STREAM, int C) {
	PLUGINS_CALL(WRITE_AP_CLAUSE_ID_PLUG, OUT, C);
}

@ Called from //if: Action Pattern Clauses// to ask for the |*_APCA| aspect
for the clause ID |C|, where |C| is a new clause ID created by the plugin. If
this is not given, then the aspect will be |MISC_APCA|.

@e ASPECT_OF_AP_CLAUSE_ID_PLUG

=
int PluginCalls::aspect_of_AP_clause_ID(int C, int *A) {
	PLUGINS_CALL(ASPECT_OF_AP_CLAUSE_ID_PLUG, C, A);
}

@ Called from //if: Action Pattern Clauses// to give plugins a chance to
decide which AP is more specific, on the basis of the extra clauses defined
in the plugin.

If the plugin recognises the patterns as ways to describe an action it knows
about, it can choose to take the decision, storing either 1 or -1 in
|rv|, and returning |TRUE|. If it instead stores 0 in |rv|, it can also
choose to set |ignore_in|, which tells the usual machinery not to judge on the
basis of the |[in: ...]| clause in the pattern.

If the plugin sees nothing relevant about the patterns, it should return |FALSE|
to let the usual machinery take its course.

@e COMPARE_AP_SPECIFICITY_PLUG

=
int PluginCalls::compare_AP_specificity(action_pattern *ap1, action_pattern *ap2,
	int *rv, int *ignore_in) {
	PLUGINS_CALL(COMPARE_AP_SPECIFICITY_PLUG, ap1, ap2, rv, ignore_in);
}

@ Called from //if: Action Pattern Clauses// to notify plugins that a clause
matching an action variable has just been added to an action pattern.

@e NEW_AP_CLAUSE_PLUG

=
int PluginCalls::new_action_variable_clause(action_pattern *ap, ap_clause *apoc) {
	PLUGINS_CALL(NEW_AP_CLAUSE_PLUG, ap, apoc);
}

@ Called from //if: Parse Clauses// to give plugins a chance to intervene in
the normal process of evaluating the meaning of text in an action pattern
clause: for example, in parsing "going nowhere", the going feature uses this
to detect that the |NOUN_AP_CLAUSE|, with text "nowhere", should not be parsed
normally. What it does it to set a bit in the bitmap |bits|, which it will pick
up again and act upon when reacting to |ACT_ON_ANL_ENTRY_OPTIONS_PLUG|.

If the plugin does not set a bit in |bits|, the normal machinery parses the
text of the clause in the normal way.

@e PARSE_AP_CLAUSE_PLUG

=
int PluginCalls::parse_AP_clause(action_name *an, anl_clause *c, int *bits) {
	PLUGINS_CALL(PARSE_AP_CLAUSE_PLUG, an, c, bits);
}

@ Called from //if: Parse Clauses// to give plugins a chance to intervene in
the type-checking process for a clause. Ordinarily, this would just check that
the contents have the right kind: if matching an action variable of kind |K|
then it must be a value compatible with |K| or a description of such.

By returning |TRUE|, a plugin can instead take responsibility for the decision
itself, bypassing that. The |outcome| should then be set |TRUE| (it's valid)
or |FALSE| (it isn't).

@e VALIDATE_AP_CLAUSE_PLUG

=
int PluginCalls::validate_AP_clause(action_name *an, anl_clause *c, int *outcome) {
	PLUGINS_CALL(VALIDATE_AP_CLAUSE_PLUG, an, c, outcome);
}

@ Called from //if: Parse Clauses// to deal with the options bitmap set
previously by a |PARSE_AP_CLAUSE_PLUG| call: see above.

@e ACT_ON_ANL_ENTRY_OPTIONS_PLUG

=
int PluginCalls::act_on_ANL_entry_options(anl_entry *entry, int entry_options, int *fail) {
	PLUGINS_CALL(ACT_ON_ANL_ENTRY_OPTIONS_PLUG, entry, entry_options, fail);
}

@ Called from //imperative: Matching Action Patterns// when assembling the requirement
clauses for compiling a mattern match; this gives plugins a chance to act
extra stipulations, which are not explicit in clauses already in the pattern.

@e SET_PATTERN_MATCH_REQUIREMENTS_PLUG

=
int PluginCalls::set_pattern_match_requirements(action_pattern *ap, int *cpm,
	int needed[MAX_CPM_CLAUSES], ap_clause *needed_apoc[MAX_CPM_CLAUSES]) {
