# This is "retrospective.mkscript", a script used to generate "retrospective.mk"
# which is used to build the old-time versions of the Inform tools stored in the
# "inform/retrospective" directory. Do not edit "retrospective.mk" directly.
# Instead, edit this script, and then rebuild "retrospective.mk" with the command:

# ../inweb/Tangled/inweb make-makefile -script retrospective/retrospective.mkscript -to retrospective/retrospective.mk

# (Or simply type "make makers" to make all of the subsidiary makefiles inside the
# inform repository, including this one.)

# See the inweb manual for documentation on the *.mkscript file format, i.e.,
# the format in which this file is written. But it is essentially just a makefile
# with a number of special macro and loop features whose syntax involves braces
# { ... }, so anywhere that you see braces, you're looking at something special
# to *.mkscript; anything else is straightforward make syntax.

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Note that the resulting makefile expects to be used with the current working
# directory set to "inform/retrospective". So it can then be invoked just as "make".
